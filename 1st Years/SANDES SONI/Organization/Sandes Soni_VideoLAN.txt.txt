 ->Technologies involved : C, C++, go & vue.js
 ->Interest level : 10
 ->Knowledge level : 7
 ->Reason for applying : VLC Mediaplayer is an app that I have been using for a long time and I'm very much interested in movies and songs. So getting an oppertunity to be a part of this company to help in developing and improving the quality of the multimedia applications it would be my genuine pleasure in doing so.
 ->If the organisation is to reject my appliction then I'll try my best in improving the skills that I lack at and try for it again if possible.
 ->If the organisation is not to return for GSOC 2019 , I  still would not consider my efforts to be in vain since till now honestly not much efforts have been taken cause I have been really enjoying this.
